# Chess king moves one square in any direction. Given two different squares of the chessboard, determine whether a king can go from the first square to the second one in a single move.
#The program receives four numbers from 1 to 8 each specifying the column and the row number, first two - for the first square, and the last two - for the second square. The program should output YES if a king can go from the first square to the second one in a single move or NO otherwise.

# Print a value:

if a1 + 1 == b1 or a1-1 == b1:
  if (a2  == b2 ): 
    print("OK")
elif (a1 == b1 and (a2+1 == b2 or a2-1 == b2)):
  print("OK2")
else:
